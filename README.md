The aim of this project was to create a dataset that simulates a measurable real-world event. The event I chose was the grades recieved by Leaving Certificate students for their Spanish exam.  I decided to investigate whether a number of factors affected the grade received by the students, the factors being the students sex, the number of hours they studied the subject per week and the number of school abscences in their exam year.

My dataset is made up of 135 students, each with the 4 variables associated with them.
The first part of the notebook is concerned with the generation of the dataset, which involved an investigation into each factor and how the variables should be distributed.

The second part of the notebook contains some analysis of the variables and examines what affect, if any, the factors have on the grades received by the students.
